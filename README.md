# Task Management Application

## Overview  
I built a simple and efficient task management application focused on core functionality and ease of use. The app provides a clean dashboard that displays tasks categorized into **upcoming, overdue, and completed** sections.  

## 🚀 Features  

### 📝 Task Management  
- Add, edit, and delete tasks.  
- Each task includes a **title, description, due date, and priority level**.  

### 🔥 Priority System  
- Tasks can be marked as **High, Medium, or Low priority**.  
- Users can update the priority of tasks at any time.  

### 🔍 Search & Filters  
- Quickly find tasks using a **search** feature.  
- Filter tasks based on **priority** and **completion status**.  

## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- **Frontend:** Built using **Vanilla JavaScript** for simplicity and performance.  
- **Data Storage:** Utilized **localStorage** to persist task data, ensuring that tasks remain available even after a page refresh.  
- **User Interface:** Designed a **minimalistic and intuitive UI** for a seamless user experience.  

## 📌 Goal  
The focus was on delivering a **functional, lightweight task manager** without unnecessary complexity.
